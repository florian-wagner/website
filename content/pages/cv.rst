Professional experience
-----------------------

    **Field Campaign, ETH Zurich, Kloten and Laegeren, Switzerland (June 2010)**

    Comprehensive geophysical field work incorporating data acquisition, processing
    and reporting. Applied measuring techniques included: Electrical Resistivity
    Tomography (ERT), Seismic Refraction Tomography (SRT), Ground Penetrating Radar
    (GPR), Electromagnetics (EM31 and EM38), Transient Electromagnetics (TEM) and
    Magnetics.

    **Internship at DMT GmbH & Co. KG, Essen, Germany (July 2010)**

    Large-scale 3D seismic survey in Jointville, France. Gained hands-on
    experiences in:

    * Large-scale data acquisition
    * Reflection & Refraction Seismics
    * Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP)
    * Well Logging
    * Quality Control

    **Research visit at the University of Alberta (September 2013)**

    I worked on acoustic and electrical analysis of reservoir sandstones in the
    Geomechanical Reservoir Experimental Facility (`GeoREF
    <http://www.geo-ref.ca>`_) of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada,
    under supervision of Dr. Chalaturnyk and his team.
