About me
========
:save_as: index.html

I am a geophysical research associate at the `GFZ German Research Centre for
Geosciences`_ in Potsdam, Germany, and an external PhD student at `ETH Zurich`_
in Switzerland. At the GFZ, I work in the geoelectrical monitoring group in
`Section 6.3 - Geological Storage`_. Prior to my PhD work, I studied `Georesources
Management`_ at RWTH Aachen University and participated in the `IDEA League
Joint Master program in Applied Geophysics`_.

My research interests include:

* Geophysical monitoring of subsurface fluid migration
* Tomographic experimental design
* Numerical modeling and inversion
* Data analysis and parallel computing

For more information see my complete `curriculum vitae`_ and a list of
scientific `publications`_.
