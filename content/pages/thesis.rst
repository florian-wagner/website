In the context of climate change, the geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO\
:sub:`2`) is considered as a transitional technology to reduce anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions. Safe and reliable geological storage requires a
thorough understanding of the storage reservoir and its induced spatiotemporal
changes. Geoelectrical monitoring techniques are highly sensitive to
compositional changes of the pore fluid and offer opportunities for
spatiotemporal imaging of fluid displacement processes. Although well
established in near-surface geophysics, the application of geoelectrical
techniques to CO\ :sub:`2` storage monitoring is relatively new and entails
specific practical and methodological challenges. This thesis investigates the
optimal locations of electrodes along the borehole trajectories, borehole
related imaging artifacts, and the integration with data sets from other
monitoring techniques by means of a process-based hydrogeophysical modeling and
inversion framework with an application to the pilot site for CO\ :sub:`2`
storage at Ketzin, Germany.
